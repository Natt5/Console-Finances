# Challenge 4 Console-Finances

## Description

The Console-Finances project is a JavaScript-based application designed to analyze and report financial data. This challenge involved some data research and writing a script to process a dataset of financial records (dates and profit/loss values) and compute several key financial indicators. 

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to apply basic JavaScript coding skills to a real-world financial dataset. The challenge was to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as total months recorded, net total of profits/losses, average monthly change, and identifying the months with the greatest increase and decrease in profits/losses.

### Specific Features

1. Calculation of total months included in the dataset.
2. Computation of net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. Determination of the average change in Profit/Losses month-over-month.
4. Identification of the greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses, along with the corresponding dates.

### Technologies Employed

HTML, JavaScript

## User Story

"As a user, I want to analyze a set of financial data, so that I can understand key financial trends and indicators such as total months, total profit/loss, average change, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits over a certain period."

## Usage

To use the Console-Finances application, please load the HTML file in a web browser and open the browser's console. The console will display the financial analysis, revealing insights such as the total number of months in the dataset, the net total of profits/losses, the average monthly change in profit/loss, and the months with the greatest increase and decrease in profits. A screenshot provided in the repository illustrates the expected output.

### Deployment

The Console-Finances project is currently deployed and available for viewing on GitHub Pages. This deployment demonstrates how I've applied my JavaScript skills to create an interactive and functional financial analysis tool.
